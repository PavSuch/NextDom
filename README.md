# NextDom

NextDOM is software evaluating the relevant call variant in the kinase domain of BCR::ABL1. The software was originally developed as a tool for processing of the results from NextGene software, however the outputs of any kind of software or your own pipeline can be used. 
NextGene finds single nucleotide variations (SNVs), but without application of any experimentally set threshold. NextDOM connects the NextGene outputs and your own threshold data set.
